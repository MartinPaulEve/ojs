About
-----
This plugin enables the export of issue, article, galley and supplementary file metadata in CrossRef format and
the registration of DOIs with CrossRef. It is based on the DatCite plugin also distributed with OJS.

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file COPYING for the
complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
Same requirements as the OJS, plus Curl .

Localization
------------
Localized titles are determined from the per-article language setting, rather than the journal locale.
As such, localized bibliographic data should be handled properly as per the CrossRef data format
guidelines, however, it has not been explicitly tested as of this release.

Contact/Support
---------------
This plugin is currently supported by the PKP Team. Please use the support forums (http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forums)
for support, bugfixes, or comments

Note
---------
In order to register DOIs with CrossRef from within OJS you will have to enter your username and password.
If you do not enter or have your own username and password you'll still be able to export into the
CrossRef XML format but you cannot register your DOIs from within OJS.
Please note, that the passowrd will be saved as plain text, i.e. not encripted, due to CrossRef registration service requirements.
